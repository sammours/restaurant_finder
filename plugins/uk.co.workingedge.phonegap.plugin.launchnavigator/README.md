=================================

Cordova/Phonegap plugin for launching today's most popular navigation/ride apps to navigate to a destination.

Platforms: Android, iOS and Windows.

Key features:

- Single, clean API to abstract away the gory details of each 3rd party app's custom URI scheme
- Detects which supported apps are installed/available on the user's device
- API to detect which features are supported by which apps on which platforms
- Out-of-the-box UI for app selection which remembers user choice
- Growing list of [supported apps](#supported-navigation-apps)

Launch Navigator is also available as a [React Native module](https://github.com/dpa99c/react-native-launch-navigator).

# General concepts

## App detection, selection and launching
- The plugin will detect which supported navigation apps are available on the device.
- By default, where this is more than one choice, it will display a list of these to the user to select for navigation.
    - This is done using native UI elements
- However, the plugin API allows you to programmatically:
    - check which apps are available on the current device
    - check which apps support which navigation options
    - launch a specific app for navigation

## Geocoding and input format of start/destination locations
- Some navigation apps require that destination/start locations be specified as coordinates, and others require an address.
    - See [App location support type wiki page](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator/wiki/App-location-type-support) for details of which apps support which location types.
- By default, this plugin will appropriately geocode or reverse-geocode the locations you provide to ensure the app receives the location in the required format.
- However, geocoding requires use of a remote service, so an internet connection is required.
- If `navigate()` is passed a location type which the selected app doesn't support, the error callback will be invoked if:
  - geocoding is disabled by passing `enableGeocoding: false` in the options object
  - there is no internet connection to perform the remote geocode operation
  - geocoding fails (e.g. an address cannot be found for the given lat/long coords)
- Note that for geocoding to work on Android, a Google API key must be specified in order to use the Google Geocoder API service (see installation instructions below).
  
## Remember user's choice of navigation app

- If the built-in app selection mechanism is used, the plugin enables the user's choice of app to be locally persisted, meaning they don't have to choose every time.
- By default, this as the user to confirm they wish their choice to be remembered.
- See the `appSelection` section of options for the [`navigate()`](#navigate) function for more details.
- See the "Advanced Example" project] in the [example repo](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator-example) for an illustrated example.

## Adding support for more apps

This plugin is a work in progress. I'd like it to support launching of as many popular navigation apps as possible.

If there's another navigation app which you think should be explicitly supported and **it provides a mechanism to externally launch it**,
open an issue containing a link or details of how the app should be invoked.

**Don't** just open an issue saying "Add support for Blah" without first finding out if/how it can be externally launched.
I don't have time to research launch mechanisms for every suggested app, so I will close such issues immediately.

# Installing

The plugin is registered on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator) as `uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator`

**IMPORTANT:** Note that the plugin will **NOT** work in a browser-emulated Cordova environment, for example by running `cordova serve` or using the [Ripple emulator](https://github.com/ripple-emulator/ripple).
This plugin is intended to launch **native** navigation apps and therefore will only work on native mobile platforms (i.e. Android/iOS/Windows).


## Using the CLI

    $ cordova plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator --variable GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="{your_api_key}"
    $ phonegap plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator --variable GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="{your_api_key}"
    $ ionic cordova plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator --variable GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="{your_api_key}"

## PhoneGap Build

Add the following xml to your config.xml to use the latest version of this plugin from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator):

    <plugin name="uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator" source="npm" >
        <variable name="GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID" value="{your_api_key}" />
    </plugin>

## Google API key for Android
- On Android, this plugin uses [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro) to geocode input addresses to lat/lon coordinates in order to support navigation apps which only allow input locations to be specified as lat/lon coordinates.
- Google now requires that an API key be specified in order to use the Geocoding API, so you'll need to obtain an API key and specify it via the `GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID` plugin variable during plugin installation.
- For more information on how to obtain an API key, see the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key).

## OKHTTP Library
- This plugin uses the [OKHTTP library](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) on Android to access Google's remote Geocoding API service
- The library is included at Android build time via Gradle
- If another plugin in your Cordova project specifies a different version of the OKHTTP library than this plugin, this can cause a Gradle version collision leading to build failure. [See #193](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator/issues/193).
- You can override the default version of the library specified by this plugin by specifying the `OKHTTP_VERSION` plugin variable during plugin installation:
    - `cordova plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator --variable GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="{your_api_key}" --variable OKHTTP_VERSION=1.2.3`
- You can find the version of the library currently specified by this plugin [in the plugin.xml](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator/blob/master/plugin.xml)

# Usage examples

## Simple usage

### Navigate to a destination address from current location.

User is prompted to choose from available installed navigation apps.

    launchnavigator.navigate("London, UK");

### Navigate to a destination with specified start location

    launchnavigator.navigate("London, UK", {
        start: "Manchester, UK"
    });

### Navigate using latitude/longitude coordinates

Coordinates can be specified as a string or array

    launchnavigator.navigate([50.279306, -5.163158], {
        start: "50.342847, -4.749904"
    });

## Advanced usage

### Navigate using a specific app

    launchnavigator.isAppAvailable(launchnavigator.APP.GOOGLE_MAPS, function(isAvailable){
        var app;
        if(isAvailable){
            app = launchnavigator.APP.GOOGLE_MAPS;
        }else{
            console.warn("Google Maps not available - falling back to user selection");
            app = launchnavigator.APP.USER_SELECT;
        }
        launchnavigator.navigate("London, UK", {
            app: app
        });
    });

### List all of the apps supported by the current platform

    var platform = device.platform.toLowerCase();
    if(platform == "android"){
        platform = launchnavigator.PLATFORM.ANDROID;
    }else if(platform == "ios"){
        platform = launchnavigator.PLATFORM.IOS;
    }else if(platform.match(/win/)){
        platform = launchnavigator.PLATFORM.WINDOWS;
    }

    launchnavigator.getAppsForPlatform(platform).forEach(function(app){
        console.log(launchnavigator.getAppDisplayName(app) + " is supported");
    });

### List apps available on the current device

    launchnavigator.availableApps(function(results){
        for(var app in results){
            console.log(launchnavigator.getAppDisplayName(app) + (results[app] ? " is" : " isn't") +" available");
        }
    });

# Supported parameters

Different apps support different input parameters on different platforms.
Any input parameters not supported by a specified app will be ignored.


The following table enumerates which apps support which parameters.

# Example projects

There are several example projects in the [example repo](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator-example) which illustrate usage of this plugin:
- SimpleExample - illustrates basic usage of the plugin
- AdvancedExample - illustrates advanced usage of the plugin
- IonicExample - illustrates usage of the plugin with the Ionic v1 framework
- Ionic2Example - illustrates usage of the plugin with the Ionic v2 framework and Ionic Native plugin wrapper.

# Platform-specifics

## Android

- Running on Android, in addition to discovering which explicitly supported apps are installed, the plugin will also detect which installed apps support using the `geo:` URI scheme for use in navigation. These are returned in the list of available apps.

- By specifying the `app` option as `launchnavigator.APP.GEO`, the plugin will invoke a native Android chooser, to allow the user to select an app which supports the `geo:` URI scheme for navigation.

- Google Maps on Android can be launched in 3 launch modes:
    - Maps mode (`launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE.MAPS`) - launches in Map view. Enables start location to be specified, but not transport mode or destination name.
    - Turn-by-turn mode (`launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE.TURN_BY_TURN`) - launches in Navigation view. Enables transport mode to be specified, but not start location or destination name.
    - Geo mode (`launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE.GEO`) - invokes Navigation view via `geo`: URI scheme. Enables destination name to be specified, but not start location or transport mode.
    - Launch mode can be specified via the `launchModeGoogleMaps` option, but defaults to Maps mode if not specified.


## Windows

- The plugin is compatible with Windows 10 on any PC or Windows 10 Mobile on a phone/tablet using the Universal .Net project generated by Cordova: `cordova platform add windows`

- Bing Maps requires the user to press the enter key to initiate navigation if you don't provide the start location.
Therefore, if a start location is not going to be passed to the plugin from your app, you should install the [Geolocation plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation) into your project.
By default, if the geolocation plugin is detected, the plugin will attempt to retrieve the current device location using it, and use this as the start location.
This can be disabled via the `enableGeolocation` option.


## iOS

### "Removing" Apple Maps
  - Since iOS 10, it is possible to "remove" built-in Apple apps, including Maps, from the Home screen.
  - Not that removing is not the same as uninstalling - the app is still actually present on the device, just the icon is removed from the Home screen.
  - Therefore it's not possible detect if Apple Maps is unavailable - `launchnavigator.availableApps()` will always report it as present.
  - The best that can be done is to gracefully handle the error when attempting to open Apple Maps using `launchnavigator.navigate()`
  - For reference, see [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39603120/how-to-check-if-apple-maps-is-installed) and the [Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204221).
  
### Apple Maps launch method

This plugin supports 2 different launch methods for launching the Apple Maps app on iOS.

- Specified by passing the `launchModeAppleMaps` option as a `launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE` constant to `navigate()`
    - `launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE.URI_SCHEME`: use the URI scheme launch method. Default if not specified.
    - `launchnavigator.LAUNCH_MODE.MAPKIT`: use the MapKit class launch method.

#### URI scheme launch method
- Launches the app using the [Apple Maps URI scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/MapLinks/MapLinks.html)
- The default method used by the plugin.
- Supports input location types of both coordinates and address string without requiring remote geocoding service (works offline)
- Doesn't support specifying nicknames for start/destination locations.

#### MapKit class launch method
- Launches the app using the [MapKit class](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitem/1452207-openmapswithitems?language=objc) to launch Apple Maps
- Only supports input location type of coordinates without requiring remote geocoding service (works offline)
- An input location type of an address (formatted as a single string) requires use of remote geocoding service (requires internet connection)
    - MapKit class input requires an address which is formatted as an [address dictionary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts/cnpostaladdress), in which the address is split into known fields such as street, city and state.  
- Support specifying nicknames for start/destination locations.
- Provides [additional launch options](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitem/launch_options_dictionary_keys?language=objc) which are not available via the URI scheme launch method.

# App-specifics

## Lyft

On both Android and iOS, the "ride type" will default to "Lyft" unless otherwise specified in the `extras` list as `id`. 

See the [Lyft documentation](https://developer.lyft.com/v1/docs/deeplinking) for URL scheme details and other supported ride types.

## 99 Taxi
On both Android and iOS, the extra parameters `client_id` and `deep_link_product_id` are required by 99 Taxi

- `client_id` should follow the pattern `MAP_***` where `***` is the client name given by the 99 Team.
    - If not specified defaults to `client_id=MAP_123`
- `deep_link_product_id` identifies the ride category
    - Currently supported values are:
        - `316` - POP ride
        - `326` - TOP ride
        - `327` - Taxis ride
    - If not specified defaults to `deep_link_product_id=316`     

On Android, 99 Taxi is currently the only app where `options.start` is a **required** parameter when calling `navigate()`
- If `navigate()` is called without a start location and the selected app is 99 Taxi, the error callback will be invoked and the 99 Taxi app will not be launched
- In order for this plugin to automatically provide start location to 99 Taxi (if it's not already specified), the native Android implementation needs to be enhanced to:
    - check/request runtime permission to use location
    - add the necessary permission entries to the `AndroidManifest.xml`
    - check/request high accuracy location is enabled (no point in requesting a low-accuracy city-level position if you want a pickup at your exact current address)
    - request a high accuracy position to determine the user's current location
    - handle errors cases such as:
        - User denies location permission
        - User denies high accuracy mode permission
        - Location cannot be retrieved
- Currently, I don't have time to do all of the above just for the case of 99 Taxi
    - However I'm willing to accept a PR request which implements the necessary native Android features.
- Otherwise/until then, you'll need to manually specify the start location for 99 Taxi
    - If the current user location is required, you can use `cordova-plugin-geolocation` to find this.
